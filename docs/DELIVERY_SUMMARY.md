## 💡 Strategic Insights

### Biggest Opportunity:
**Presencial/offline recording** - Nobody focuses here. This is Always' moat.

### Biggest Threat:
**Otter's brand** - 95% user satisfaction, huge recognition. Must differentiate clearly.

### Quickest Wins:
1. Multi-language (Deepgram already supports it)
2. Custom vocabulary (straightforward feature)
3. Export formats (easy to implement)

### Long-term Moats:
1. Offline-first architecture (hard to replicate)
2. Confirmation system (behavioral lock-in)
3. Vertical features (regulatory barriers)

## 🎓 Lessons from Competitors

- Generous free tiers (Fathom: unlimited storage)
- Multi-language support (Fireflies: 100+ languages)
- Sales coaching (tl;dv: scorecards, analytics)

### What Doesn't Work:
- Hidden pricing (tl;dv: 404 error on /pricing)
- Too restrictive free tier (users churn)
- Intrusive bots (Zoom bot can be awkward)
- Hardware pivots (Rewind: failed, acquired)
